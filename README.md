# IBM-Project-10884-1659241904
IoT Based Safety Gadget for Child Safety Monitoring & Notification

Project Flow:

The GPS coordinates of the child will be sent to the IBM IoT platform

Location can be viewed in the Web Application

A parent can create a geofence in the web application

The web application will check if the child is inside or outside the geofence

Notifies the parents if the child goes out of the geofence


To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below:


Create and configure IBM Cloud Services(refer sprint-2)

Create IBM Watson IoT Platform (refer sprint-2)

Create a device & configure the IBM IoT Platform(refer sprint-2)

Create Node-RED service (refer sprint-3)

Create a database in Cloudant DB to store location data (refer sprint-3)

Develop a web Application using Node-RED Service (refer sprint-3)

Develop the web application using Node-RED (refer sprint-3)

Integrate the geofence & google map (refer sprint-4)

Develop a python script to publish the location details to the IBM IoT platform (refer sprint-2,3,4)
